     - add LiLo boot support (default will always stay Grub)
     - add swap partition as extended by default instead of primary (this would allow gentoo-lvm.profile and another system to dual boot)
     - add some work about the new kernel 'make localmodconfig' from 2.6.32
     - add 'precompiled' options to $kernel_sources and provide a binary kernel instead of sources (gain time)
DONE   - 1 kernel for normal install
       - 1 kernel for luks install
       - 1 kernel for lvm install
     - add Btrfs support
