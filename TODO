- add LiLo boot support (default will always stay GRUB)
- add swap partition as extended by default instead of primary (this would allow gentoo-lvm.profile and another system to dual boot)
- make a gentoo-luks-lvm.profile
- add SETUP="luks lvm" support for modules/setup.sh and make functions to test setup type
  SETUP="" is default
  SETUP="luks" is luks
  SETUP="luks lvm" is luks+lvm
  take care of vgchange warning using this
  if is_setup "lvm" return 0 then call lvm_cleanup
